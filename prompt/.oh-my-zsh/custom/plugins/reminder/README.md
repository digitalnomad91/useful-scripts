# oh-my-zsh-reminder
A very very simple OhMyZsh plugin which displays reminders above every prompt

This small plugin allows your terminal to remind you that you have somethind to do.
Start adding a task :

    $ todo Delete this task
    Todo :
      - Delete this task

    $

You can add an other one :

    $ todo Keep this one
    Todo :
      - Delete this task
      - Keep this one

    $

When a task is done, remove it from the list :

    $ task_done Delete
    Todo :
      - Keep this one

    $

When all tasks are done, reminder vanishes :

    $ task_done Keep

    $

That's all for the moment. As I said, very very simple. Maybe will be improved later.

# Installation

To install, clone the repo into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` (ZSH plugins don't allow dashes, so make sure you clone it into a single-word folder):
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexisBRENON/oh-my-zsh-reminder ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/reminder
```

Then add it to your list of plugins in `~/.zshrc` (e.g `plugins=(reminder common-aliases extract git sudo taskwarrior)`).
